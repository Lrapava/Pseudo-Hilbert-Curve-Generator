# Pseudo Hilbert Curve Generator
A simple program for generating pseudo Hilbert curves.

# How to use?
Compile and run the program with 2 or three command-line arguments.
The first command-line argument describes the order of the curve.
The second command-line argument describes spacing.
If you don's specify the third argument, the program will output the curve in the form of ASCII art.
The third command-line argument describes the thickness of every cell in pixels.
Arter specifying the third argument, you should write the output of the program to a .ppm file. 
You can now open the .ppm file as an image and view the curve.
I strongly recommend converting the .ppm file to a .png file for extra (lossless) compression 
.png files are also a little bit easier to share online
